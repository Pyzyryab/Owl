# Owl Framework

## What is `Owl`?

`Owl` it's a little project started to study some concrete areas of software development. 

Some of them are:

## General
- Learn and master `Modern C++`
- TDD or test driven development
- Software architecture, and how to design a complex project in all it's aspects, not only the source code.
- Understand, assimilate and practice the fundations of the `SOLID` clean code principles on a more advance level.
- Make and http server implementation from scratch and apply http protocols, mapping, routing, serving and securing data....

## Platform specific (Microsoft Build Tools and Azure Dev Tools)
One target of this project it's to delve on the Microsoft specific solutions for the `C++` world, like specific testing frameworks, debuggers, IDE, cloud solutions (Azure), the MSBUILD compiler and the `Msil` pseudolanguage from the `.NET` world, which allows us to implement o `reflection` on `C++`, which does not exists natively (at least until the C++20 standard).
